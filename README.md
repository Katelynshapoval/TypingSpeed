## Introduction

The "Typing Speed Test App using React" project demonstrates the creation of a typing speed test application using React. Users can practice their typing skills by entering text as accurately and quickly as possible.

## Features

### Real-time Typing Test

Users are presented with a passage of text that they must type out. The app tracks each key press and displays the remaining portion of the text that needs to be typed.

### Timer

The app includes a timer that counts down from 60 seconds. Users must complete typing the passage before the timer runs out.

### Accuracy Tracking

As users type, the app tracks the accuracy of their input. Incorrectly typed characters are highlighted, helping users identify and correct mistakes.

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the application using the command: `npm start`.
4. The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Code Explanation

The provided React code demonstrates how to build a Typing Speed Test App. Key features and concepts include:

- Tracking user input and comparing it to the provided passage.
- Implementing a timer that counts down from 60 seconds.
- Highlighting incorrectly typed characters for accuracy tracking.
- Using the `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` hooks for state management and handling key events.

The app is structured with components such as `TextField` for displaying text input fields and `Analysis` for providing feedback on typing speed and accuracy.


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
